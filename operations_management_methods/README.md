# operations_management_methods (version == 0.5)

This is a package for operations management that I am currently working on. The following packages are used:
- numpy
- math
- scipy.stats
- matplotlib.pyplot

The package can be installed as follows:

`pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ operations-management-methods==version`

The package currently contains 2 classes that can be imported:

1. **Simplex:**

This class contains the simplex method. This makes it possible to solve a production planning problem with several machine bottlenecks.

2. **InventoryManagement:**
